# AI Based Traffic Light Controller

## Description
To tackle the traffic issues in urban areas, we have proposed a smart **Reinforcement Learning(RL)** based traffic light controller capable of **real-time monitoring** of traffic conditions and **adaptation of traffic light timings** accordingly. 

## Algorithm
We have used Soft Actor Critic algorithm for developing the RL agent which involves training for multiple episodes with a novel state space and reward function. Extensive research has been conducted to develop state spaces and reward functions for designing a reinforcement learning-based agent that not only ensures a smooth traffic experience but also promotes eco-friendly practices.
